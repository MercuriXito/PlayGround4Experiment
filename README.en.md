This project aim to record some experimental code. Some of these are sample code for blogs, or implemented code for interesting papers.

## list codes:

* `KL-divergence-experiment`: This forlder contain code explaining KL divergence, also available on [my blog](mercurixito.github.io)

* `Formal-language-recognition`: This forlder contain code about formal language which is an assignment. It mainly include implementational code of
    - `Regular Grammar` and an algorithm to judge if a string could be generated by it.
    - `Context-free Grammar in Chomksy Normal Form` and an algorithm to judge if a string could be generated by it.

* `cGAN-MLP`: A demo to train cGAN on MNIST with pytorch.
